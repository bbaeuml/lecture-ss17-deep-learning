# Code samples for the lecture "Deep Learning in Robotics"

This repository contains code samples for my lecture on ["Deep Learning in Robotics"](http://www6.in.tum.de/Main/TeachingSS2017DeepLearning).

The code is written for Python 2.7. but might run on Python 3 with small modifications.

Many programs need ["TensorFlow 1.2"](https://www.tensorflow.org) being installed.

The repository does not include sample data. They can be downloaded from:
["MNIST"](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/data/mnist.pkl.gz)
